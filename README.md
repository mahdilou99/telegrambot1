tg-cli is being obsoleted
-------------------------

If you are not interested in tg-cli particular options like invite, del_msg, create groups...

We recommend to you use this API Bot written in lua: https://github.com/RememberTheAir/GroupButler from a very good friend.

telegrambot1-bot
============

A Telegram Bot based on plugins using [tg](https://github.com/vysheng/tg).

[Installation](https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot/wiki/Installation)
------------
```bash
# Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, for other OSs check out https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot/wiki/Installation
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libevent-dev make unzip git redis-server g++ libjansson-dev libpython-dev expat libexpat1-dev tmux subversion
```

```bash
# After those dependencies, lets install the bot
cd $HOME #Do not write this if you are using c9 or not root accounts
git clone https://github.com/Josepdal/DBTeam.git
cd DBTeam
./launch.sh install
./launch.sh # Will ask you for a phone number & confirmation code.
```
You can also use this command to install the bot in just one step.
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libevent-dev make unzip git redis-server g++ libjansson-dev libpython-dev expat libexpat1-dev tmux subversion -y && cd $HOME && rm -rf DBTeam && rm -rf .telegram-cli && git clone https://github.com/Josepdal/DBTeam.git && cd DBTeam && ./launch.sh install && ./launch.sh
```
Then, you have to install a bot language like this:
```
#install english_lang
#lang en
```

Enable more [`plugins`](https://github.com/yagop/Talibot/tree/supergroups/plugins)
-------------
See the plugins list with `#plugins` command.

Enable a disabled plugin by `#plugins enable [name]`.

Disable an enabled plugin by `#plugins disable [name]`.

Those commands require a privileged user, privileged users are defined inside `data/config.lua` (generated by the bot), stop the bot and edit if necessary.


Keep the bot always running
------------
If your bot stops sometimes due to crashes or freezes in telegram-cli, and you want to keep it running all the time
you can start the bot this way. Note that it only will be recovering the bot if the problem is a telegram-cli issue,
it won't recover of vps hibernation or system problems.

You need to have [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) or [`screen`](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen) installed.
Both are pre installed in almost all linux distributions, but in case you don't you can get it this way: `sudo apt-get install tmux screen`             
Tmux and screen are two different terminal multiplexer programs that will be needed in order to use the script.

You can use __`steady.sh`__ script in two ways: with `tmux`_(recomended)_ or with `screen`. You may also mix them, but it is not assured to work.                        
                                
####Using tmux
To start the script with tmux, just run this command in your Bot folder:             
```bash
tmux new-session -s script "bash steady.sh -t"
```
Where `tmux` is the terminal multiplexer, `new-session -s` means that we want to open a tmux session with a name, `script` is the name of that session and with `"bash steady.sh -t"` we are launching  _steady.sh_ with the argument `-t` (tmux mode).        
The script will launch and it will show you if there is any error.             
         

The bot will be running in the background even if SSH session closes. You can just detach (get out) the tmux session by typing _Control+b_ and _d_                                                     
                                    
                                    
If you want to get inside the script session again, type: `tmux attach-session -t script`       
If you want to get into Bot session (reading the messages), write: `tmux attach-session -t DBTeam`             
               

You can stop the script by pressing _Control+C_ in the script session. Alternatively, you can `tmux kill-session -t script` or also killing all tmux processes `killall tmux`. Remember that you can exit without closing the session with _Control+b_ and _d_.                                   


####Using screen
Firstly kill all the telegram-cli and screen processes running on your vps:
```bash
killall screen
killall telegram-cli
```        
Then you have to launch the script (you need to be in DBTeam folder):
```bash
screen bash steady.sh -s
```          

Now you can close the SSH session and it will be running in the background. You can also just detach the screen by typing _Control+a_ and _Control+d_           

If you want to get inside the session again, type:
`screen -x`                      
You will be shown a message saying "_There are several suitable screens on:_" and two lines similar to this ones:
```
12345.xxxxxxx  (Date)  (Detached)                 
67890.pts.xxx  (Date)  (Detached)           
```
If you write: `screen -x 12345` (the number above), you will be in the telegram session of the bot reading the messages.
Writing: `screen -x 67890` (the number below), you will be in the script screen. Remember that you can go back with _Control+a_ and _Control+d_.



To stop all the processes related to the bot and the script, type:
```
killall screen
killall tmux
killall telegram-cli
```                        






Bot status is checked every 10 seconds (default) and printed on the screen. You can change this value editing the script ($RELOADTIME).               

The script has __more usages__, like starting sessions detached. Type `bash steady.sh -h` to see all the commands and information about the script.                    
                          
It is also possible to use __steady.sh__ for other bots. You only need to change $BOT variable. This can be usefull to have more bots in the same server _(this feature is only avaliable in tmux mode)_                           
 


Run it as a daemon
------------
If your Linux/Unix comes with [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) you can run the bot by this way
```bash
$ sed -i "s/yourusername/$(whoami)/g" etc/telegram.conf
$ sed -i "s_telegrambotpath_$(pwd)_g" etc/telegram.conf
$ sudo cp etc/telegram.conf /etc/init/
$ sudo start telegram # To start it
$ sudo stop telegram # To stop it
```
